Weather Forecasting Analysis: Analyze weather data and  apply statistical techniques to predict weather patterns.
This project, “Weather Forecasting Analysis,” focuses on analyzing historical weather data to understand patterns and predict future weather trends. The main technique used here is regression analysis, which helps find the relationship between variables like temperature and time. Regression allows us to estimate future values based on historical trends, making it a simple yet effective approach for prediction. 
The project uses Python as the main programming language, along with libraries like Pandas for handling large datasets and Matplotlib for visualization. The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle’s Historical Hourly Weather Data, which provides real-world weather information collected over a long period.

#How to use
This repository contains multiple files consisting of main file (PROJECT1.ipynb), a python file consisting the codes. Its better to run it in jupiterpy.
Here Three dataset are present (temperature.csv)(pressure.csv) and (humidity.csv). The code combines the three dataset and merge into one, cleans it and apply regression.
